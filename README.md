## Aim  
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts.  
The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.

---

## Tools Used  
- **DALL·E (OpenAI)**  
- **Stable Diffusion**

---



## Final Generated Image  

### 🖼️ AI-Generated Image (Red Vintage Car)
<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a32acb06-1ddd-4ced-9d51-37a69a13ebf3" />

## Prompts Used

### **Image 1: Red Vintage Car**
- **Basic Prompt:**  
  `A vintage red car parked on a city street.`

- **Refined Prompt:**  
  `A realistic photograph of a classic red vintage car parked on a cobblestone street lined with old European buildings under bright sunlight.`

- **Alternate Prompt (Used for Final Generation):**  
  `A striking red vintage car resting on a sunlit cobblestone street, surrounded by charming European architecture. The car shines with chrome details and classic curves, reflecting the warmth of the afternoon light.`

- **Basic Prompt:**  
  `A cup of coffee with latte art on a table.`

- **Refined Prompt:**  
  `A realistic close-up of a cup of cappuccino with heart-shaped latte art on a wooden table beside a book in warm sunlight.`

- **Alternate Prompt (Optional):**  
  `A cozy morning café scene showing a white ceramic coffee cup with heart-shaped latte art, resting on a rustic wooden table near an open book and soft window light.`

## Comparison Report

### **Image 1 (Red Vintage Car):**
- The **generated image** closely matched the **original** in terms of lighting, texture, and composition.  
- The **cobblestone street** and **European-style buildings** were well captured.  
- Slight variations were observed in the **car’s shape and reflections**, but the overall **aesthetic and tone** were well reproduced.

### **Image 2 (Coffee with Latte Art):**
- The generated image successfully mimicked the **lighting**, **warm tone**, and **focus** of the original.  
- Minor variations were noticed in the **latte art pattern** and **table grain**, but the **cozy ambience** remained consistent.

---

## Conclusion  
By analyzing and refining prompts, the AI-generated images effectively replicated the originals with high accuracy.  
This experiment highlights the importance of **prompt engineering**, **attention to visual detail**, and **iterative refinement** when using text-to-image models like **DALL·E** and **Stable Diffusion**.
